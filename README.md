## New Feature: Display GitHub Handle on Active Cell

When a gallery cell is active, it now displays the contributor's GitHub handle on top of their avatar. The handle is displayed in gold color, with a font size equal to the cell size, centered, and with a black text shadow. The handle's z-index is set to 12 to ensure it appears on top of the avatar image.
